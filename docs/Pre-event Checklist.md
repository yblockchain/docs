# Pre-event Checklist
Want an extensive rundown, sorted by the days leading up to the event? We've got you sorted. 

## 14 Days to Go
If you've procrastinated and are only just getting started on putting the event together, now is the right time to start. At 2 weeks to go for your event, here's what you'll need to start with: 

 - [ ] **Choose a theme:** It's a great idea to have a theme for your event. Your theme reflects what the event is going to be about. 

 - [ ] **Find a [speaker](https://yblockcha.in/#mentors) or a guest:** Every event needs a special guest who will deliver an address. 
 
 - [ ] **Confirm a date and time:** Find the best time to conduct your event considering factors such as when your target audience would be free. Consider a weekend. 

 - [ ] **Know your target audience and how to reach them:** For example, if you're targeting a working crowd, emails might be your best way to get the word around. If your audience is on the younger side, social media would effectively do the trick.

 - [ ] **Make a [poster](https://www.canva.com/design/DAET2jdeGT8/-UZ6ew1HpLZyxMdgleWkDg/view?utm_content=DAET2jdeGT8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) and a [blurb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4lBzJVAgR2qdTpLFdZgnesL3e8ZsCDkgqyFi5zMwBo/edit?usp=sharing) to advertise:** If you're an expert at graphic designing, you've probably already got this in the bag. But fret not if you're not a very creative person, a simple and practical poster is all you need. You would also need a blurb to go with the poster when you advertise the event. Most importantly, *don't forget to add the YBlockchain [logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXT3TOqmZcfcnextgEXAVfUbXkYcgErM/view?usp=sharing)!*


## 7 Days To Go
By now, you should have a theme, a guest speaker, a poster and a blurb to be able to advertise. With 7 days to go till your event, here's what you need to do:

 - [ ] **Send out poster and invites along with a  [registration link](https://forms.gle/GyCDRYRaCbtGHtKq7):**  Itâ€™s time to get the word out there. We recommend sending out a registration link to get an idea on how many people to expect.

  
    
- [ ] **Confirm the agenda for the event:**  Make sure everything planned for the event fits the theme and double check on the guest and other agenda items.

## 3 Days To Go

 - [ ] **Send out reminders:** In case thereâ€™s someone who missed the invite you sent out 4 days ago, theyâ€™ll be sure to see it now. It also wouldn't hurt to remind those who have already seen it ðŸ˜œ

## 1 Day To Go

 - [ ] **Send out the link to the event:** If your event is online, be sure to send out the link to the event to those who registered for it, the day before your event. 
 
 - [ ] **Conduct a dry run:** It's always a good idea to roughly run through the entire event beforehand to make sure you aren't forgetting anything. 
 - [ ] **Have an emcee:** It's essential to have a person who will host the event, introduce the speaker and be a moderator during the course of the event. 

## On the Day
- [ ] Make sure your **speaker and host are ready**.

- [ ] At 1 hour to go, **send a reminder** along with the meeting link to our [Discord community](http://chat.yblockcha.in/).
-   [ ] If you haven't already, at 30 minutes to go, c**onduct a dry run** of the event.
-  [ ] 5 minutes into the event, share a screenshot of the event with your community to **announce that you are live**.
