There isn't a lot to do after your event, but many would say these are the most crucial steps. 
-  **Share the feedback link** towards the end of the event.

-  **Stay till everyone has left** and end the meeting.
-  **Post feedback link on discord** as well for anyone who didn't receive it during the event.
-  **Thank everyone** in the community for attending.
