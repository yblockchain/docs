What's ours is yours. At YBlockchain, we truly believe in the idea of decentralization and open sourcing and we practice what we preach. To help you represent YBlockchain better, we've put together everything that makes up our identity on screen. Welcome to the YBlockchain Brand Kit!

## Colours
The world is replete with infinite colours, that can sway thinking, change actions and cause reactions. 

These are the colours that make up our world:

**White:**  #FFFFFF

**Blue:** - #0d6efd

**Light Blue:** #f2f6ff

**Green:** #00bd77

**Dark Blue:** #091a2b

**Black:** #000000

## Logo and Header

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. The YBlockchain logo - a circle with the letters ‘Yb’ written inside, embodies simplicity.

And this logo is the face of our organisation. On the same note, we request you to not make any changes to the logo or edit it in any way.

Less is more. Much like our minimalistic logo, the YBlockchain header is simply the word ‘Yblockchain’ in our representative colours and font.

The font is the last piece that completes the puzzle of branding. The font we use is: **Poppins**
