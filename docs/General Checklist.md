If you're running short of time and want a quick run down on all the things you'd need to arrange for the event, you're at the right place. This general checklist has everything you'd need to be able to host your own YBlockchain event.
 
 

 - **Choose a theme:** It's a great idea to have a theme for your event. Your theme reflects what the event is going to be about. 

 - **Find a [speaker](https://yblockcha.in/#mentors) or a guest:** Every event needs a special guest who will deliver an address. 
 
 - **Confirm a date and time:** Find the best time to conduct your event considering factors such as when your target audience would be free. Consider a weekend. 

 - **Know your target audience and how to reach them:** For example, if you're targeting a working crowd, emails might be your best way to get the word around. If your audience is on the younger side, social media would effectively do the trick.

 - **Make a [poster](https://www.canva.com/design/DAET2jdeGT8/-UZ6ew1HpLZyxMdgleWkDg/view?utm_content=DAET2jdeGT8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) and a [blurb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4lBzJVAgR2qdTpLFdZgnesL3e8ZsCDkgqyFi5zMwBo/edit?usp=sharing) to advertise:** If you're an expert at graphic designing, you've probably already got this in the bag. But fret not if you're not a very creative person, a simple and practical poster is all you need. You would also need a blurb to go with the poster when you advertise the event. Most importantly, *don't forget to add the YBlockchain [logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXT3TOqmZcfcnextgEXAVfUbXkYcgErM/view?usp=sharing)!*

 - **Send out poster and invites along with a [registration link](https://forms.gle/GyCDRYRaCbtGHtKq7) at T-7:** With 7 days to go till your event, it's time to get the word out there. We recommend sending out a registration link to get an idea on how many people to expect. 
 - **Confirm the agenda for the event:** Make sure everything planned for the event fits the theme and double check on guest and other agenda items.
 - **Send out reminders at T-3:** In case there's someone who missed the invite you sent out 4 days ago, they'll be sure to see it now. 
 - **Send out the link to the event at T-1:** If your event is online, be sure to send out the link to the event to those who registered for it, the day before your event. 
 - **Conduct a dry run at T-1:** It's always a good idea to roughly run through the entire event beforehand to make sure you aren't forgetting anything. 
 - **Have an emcee:** It's essential to have a person who will host the event, introduce the speaker and be a moderator during the course of the event. 
 - **Ensure an interactive, fun session!** This one is self explanatory. No one likes a dull, boring event 
 - **Circulate a [feedback link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YmExVxXHLIp0AeWh5uXAWoufjB7kPS_9YfEJCMUz84I/viewform?edit_requested=true):** Getting feedback is an essential part of any event. We always strive to improve!
